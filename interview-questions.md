Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

From Developer Tori

Your answer: JSX is a place inside a file that mixes HTML and JavaScript. In order to reference JavaScript within JSX, it needs to be held in {curly braces}, the curly braces make known to JSX that JavaScript will be used there. HTML is the backbone coding language and JSX allows there to be action.

Researched answer: JSX stands for JavaScript syntax extension and allows developers to write HTML elements in JavaScript which converts HTML tags to react elements. HTML is its own standard markup language that was designed for web browsers and JSX allows HTML to be written inside of react by using JavaScript.

3. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

From Developer Shaun

Your answer: State values are stored in the state, while props are are things that are passed on between components and the app.

Researched answer:In React, both state and props are used to manage and pass data, but they serve distinct purposes. State is internal to a component and represents mutable data that the component can manage and change. It is typically used for data that can be modified within the component, often in response to user interactions or events. In contrast, props are external and immutable data passed to a component from its parent. They are used to configure and customize a component's behavior and appearance. While state allows a component to manage its own data, props facilitate data flow and communication between parent and child components in a React application.

4. What is the DOM?

From Developer Mal

Your answer: DOM is used to update the webpage in React. DOM events are user interactions that provide triggers to enact certain changes on the webpage.

Researched answer: DOM stands for Document Object Module and represents the HTML structure on the webpage.
